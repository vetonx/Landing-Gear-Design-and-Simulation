# Landing-Gear-Design-and-Simulation

--> "LandingGearStructure.txt" gives general information relative to authors, course and contents of the project

--> "LandingGearDesignandSimulation.pdf" contains a PDF file in which it is explained the designing procedure
The designing phases are not complete. Steps regarding the oleodynamic Simscape schemes and simulations are not available.

--> "www.youtube.com:watch?v=mQJ-M_PU3yc.webloc" recalls the YouTube link to the video that shows the evolution of 
position, velocity, pressure evolution during the landing procedure.

Further information relative to selection of commercial components and Simscape simulation can be asked via LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/veton-sulejmani-b05aa3229/
