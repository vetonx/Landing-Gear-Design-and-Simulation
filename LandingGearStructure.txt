*** Design and dynamic simulation of the landing gear procedure of an Airbus A320 ***
The group project aims are to define the kinematic of the landing gear, based on the 
real kinematic chain, to select the commercial off-the shelf components able to ensure
the oleodynamic/pneumatic correct operativity of the landing gear in a landing procedure.
The simulation was performed with Simscape (from Matlab).

Contents of the project: 
- mechanical analysis of the kinematic chain
- mechanical analysis of the landing phases
- static and dynamic loads analysis
- selection of the appropriate oleodynamic components
- computation of the proper localized and distributed drops 
- creation of the oleodynamic circuit
- creation of the block diagram circuit
- simulation of the landing gear procedure 
- simulation of velocity, pressure and position evolution during landing gear procedure
